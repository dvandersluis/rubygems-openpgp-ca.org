Questions?  Comments?
---------------------

Feel free to shoot me an email: kgo at grant-olson dot net.  My
OpenPGP key is 0xE3B5806F.  I always use an encryption-capable email
client so feel free to encrypt, even if it's just for fun.

Same contact info as above.

If you need to send an encrypted email by don't have the correct
software installed, you can use
[privacybox](https://privacybox.de/grant.msg). If you do so, please
include a contact email in the message. Also note I will be unable to
