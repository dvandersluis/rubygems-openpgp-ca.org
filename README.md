Experimental Rubygem OpenPGP Certificate Authority
==================================================

This project intends to provide a basic certificate authority for gems
signed via rubygems-openpgp.

Although it will not perform full authentication of keys, it will:

1. Validate that a user has control of email.

2. Validate that a user has control of their private key.

If these two conditions are met, an authentication signature will be
generated by the signing authority.

Note that this does not (yet) solve the problem of tying a key to an
individual rubygems.org account or any particular gem.
