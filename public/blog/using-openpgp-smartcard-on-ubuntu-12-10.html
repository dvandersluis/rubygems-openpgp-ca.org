<h1>Using an OpenPGP Smartcard on Ubuntu 12.10</h1>

<p>I'm currently adding a key continuity feature to rubygems-openpgp.  It
works similar to the way that ssh stores copies of known host keys,
and warns you if the key has changed.</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm trying to store any changes locally, and
was a bit worried about the directories being created properly on
Windows.  So I decided to setup a VirtualBox install of Windows 8.  My
current hard drive was out of space, so that gave me an excuse to buy
a nice new SSD drive.  And that led to installing the latest version
of Ubuntu.  And now my Saturday is almost gone.</p>

<p>I had a little trouble getting my OpenPGP smartcard setup, so I
thought I'd write about it here.</p>

<h2>Problem 1 - scdaemon is in the Wrong Package</h2>

<p>This is actually a problem on the Debian packages that has existed for
many years.  If you want to use gpg2, the scdaemon won't get installed
unless you install the gpgsm package:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gpgsm
</code></pre>

<p>That one I was expecting.  But I thought I'd document it here anyway.</p>

<h2>Problem 2 - Can't Access the Card</h2>

<p>This one I hadn't seen before:</p>

<p>I got the following error with gpg2:</p>

<pre><code>grant@johnicicleboy:~$ gpg2 --card-status
gpg: selecting openpgp failed: Unsupported certificate
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Unsupported certificate
</code></pre>

<p>gpg fails as well:</p>

<pre><code>grant@johnicicleboy:~$ gpg --card-status
gpg: selecting openpgp failed: unknown command
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error
</code></pre>

<p>There were a few areas where this same issue was reported, but I
couldn't find any resolution to the problem.</p>

<p>After some extensive googling, I was able to find out that the
<code>gnome-keyring-daemon</code> now decides to grab control of your smartcard
reader.  Sure enough, I killed the process and <code>gpg2 --card-status</code>
started working:</p>

<pre><code>grant@johnicicleboy:~$ gpg2 --card-status
Application ID ...: D2760001240102000005000009200000
Version ..........: 2.0
Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl

                      card-no: 0005 00000920
</code></pre>

<p>Now I began the search for ways to disable the smartcard functionality
on <code>gnome-keyring-daemon</code>.  Couldn't find anything.  There were ways
to switch off its ssh-agent replacement, which I wanted to do anyway
since I ssh authenticate via my smartcard.  There were some other
settings about pkcs11 and secrets that seemed promising.  So I ran the
following commands to disable these features:</p>

<pre><code>gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false
gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/secrets false
gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/pkcs11 false
</code></pre>

<p>But disabling them didn't do the trick.</p>

<p>Next I went with a hack fix and basically nuked the gnome-keyring-daemon:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon.bak
</code></pre>

<p>This didn't <em>seem</em> to have broken anything too horribly, and I never
liked the gnome keyring or seahorse to begin with.  So I decided to write a blog post for the sake of the interwebz.</p>

<h2>But Then, A Complication</h2>

<p>After all that I went to write things up.  I decided to re-break
things so I could obtain the error message that <code>gpg --card-status</code>
threw.  So I moved the <code>gnome-keyring-daemon</code> back into place.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, everything worked!  Both <code>gpg</code> and <code>gpg2</code> were able to
access the card just fine.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe after I configured gpg-agent to act as the
ssh-agent, it was grabbing my smart-card before gnome-keyring-daemon
could.  So I commented out the entries for that, and sure enough card
reading was broken again.</p>

<h2>The Proper Fix (or is it?)</h2>

<p>Add this to ~/.gnupg-agent.conf to enable ssh support:</p>

<pre><code>enable-ssh-support
</code></pre>

<p>Add this to ~/.bashrc to use gpg-agent for ssh instead of
gnome-keyring-daemon, substituting your host name:</p>

<p>if [ -f "${HOME}/.gnupg/gpg-agent-info-HOSTNAME" ]; then</p>

<pre><code>       . "${HOME}/.gnupg/gpg-agent-info-HOSTNAME"
       export GPG_AGENT_INFO
       export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
     fi
</code></pre>

<h2>Another Complication!</h2>

<p>Everything seemed to be working, but then I got this generic error
message from Enigmail:</p>

<pre><code>No SmartCard 
could not be found in your reader 
Please insert your SmartCard and repeat the operation.
</code></pre>

<p>After enabling a debug log, it turned out the error was the same
unsupported certificate error I was getting before, even though
signing still worked from the command line.  Killing the
gnome-keyring-daemon process allowed me to sign emails again.</p>

<p>So, I went back to:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon.bak
</code></pre>

<p>And everything seems to be working... for now.</p>

<h2>That's All for Now</h2>

<p>If you've encountered the same problem, hopefully this will help.</p>

<p>-Grant</p>
