      <p class='blog_preview'>Key Revocation If your key is compromised or simply lost, you'll need to revoke it. This relies on generation of a revocation key. Backing Up Your Key and Generating a Revocation Certificate If you are signing your gems and haven't done this yet, please do so: gpg --armor --export-secret-keys &gt; /media/usb_stick/key_backup.asc gpg --gen-revoke 0xDEADBEEF &gt; /media/usb_stick/key_revoke.asc Note that the exported secret key is still encrypted with your passphrase and relatively safe.

      <p class='blog_preview'>There's Trust and Then There's Trust and Then There's Trust Trust is important when it comes to software packages. Unfortunately it's also an overloaded word that has multiple meanings. Lets talk about three different kinds of trust. Trust (a.k.a. Trustworthiness) This one is the most important. Unfortunately it's also the hardest one to verify pragmatically. How do you know that this gem you install won't fry your hard drive? That it won't install a key-logger?...
