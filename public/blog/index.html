      <p class='blog_preview'>Our previous authentication policy required that you registered with the same email address as your rubygems.org account. The intent was to demonstrate that you were authorized to publish to the rubygems account. We've run into a few cases where this wasn't practical. In one case a user wanted to use an organizational key that wasn't tied to the actual rubygems.org user email. In a few other cases, users had previously registered with legacy emails and...

This release corrects a minor issue where a Windows machine couldn't
sign an existing gem built on linux.

Verifying Your Initial Install

Existing users of rubygems-openpgp can verify the install with
rubygems-openpgp itself:



It is recommended that new users fetch the gem and verify it against a
detached signature.  Instructions on how to do so can be found at the
Guide to Verifying Your Initial Install.

Detached signature for the 0.5.1 release

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>I'm currently adding a key continuity feature to rubygems-openpgp. It works similar to the way that ssh stores copies of known host keys, and warns you if the key has changed. This is the first time I'm trying to store any changes locally, and was a bit worried about the directories being created properly on Windows. So I decided to setup a VirtualBox install of Windows 8. My current hard drive was out of space,...

      <p class='blog_preview'>Trust is important when it comes to software packages. Unfortunately it's also an overloaded word that has multiple meanings. Lets talk about three different kinds of trust. Trust (a.k.a. Trustworthiness) This one is the most important. Unfortunately it's also the hardest one to verify pragmatically. How do you know that this gem you install won't fry your hard drive? That it won't install a key-logger? You don't. And unfortunately this is very hard to verify...

      <p class='blog_preview'>This is a contentious topic. It's right up there with Emacs vs Vim. Kirk vs Picard. Jesus vs Santa. Etc. Some people have been dismissive of rubygems-openpgp. "Why not use X.509? That has native ruby libraries! You don't need to rely on gpg!" And I'm ashamed to say I've been equally dismissive. "Because X.509 sucks! It's broken!
