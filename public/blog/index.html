      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>My computer just died. I threw the hard drive into another computer. Everything looked good until it tried to fire up X and then I just got a blank screen. You know what that means. Time to reinstall the OS. There were a few gotchas that I thought I'd document here. Live CD doesn't mount encrypted partitions I run full disk encryption. After my computer died I wanted to grab a few files and backup...

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>People who are signing gems today via the built-in signing mechanism are using self-signed certificates. In general this is a bad idea. That's why your web browser will give you a nasty warning if you go to an https site that uses a self-signed certificate. A self-signed certificate is the digital equivalent of saying, "Dude! Of course I'm 21! Why would I make that up?" But there's an even bigger problem with this approach than...

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>Our previous authentication policy required that you registered with the same email address as your rubygems.org account. The intent was to demonstrate that you were authorized to publish to the rubygems account. We've run into a few cases where this wasn't practical. In one case a user wanted to use an organizational key that wasn't tied to the actual rubygems.org user email. In a few other cases, users had previously registered with legacy emails and...

      <p class='blog_preview'>On Feb-20-2013 at approximately 10:00 GMT a mysterious user known only as Havenwood was able to bypass several layers of security and receive certification from the authority without proper authentication.

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>I'm currently adding a key continuity feature to rubygems-openpgp. It works similar to the way that ssh stores copies of known host keys, and warns you if the key has changed. This is the first time I'm trying to store any changes locally, and was a bit worried about the directories being created properly on Windows. So I decided to setup a VirtualBox install of Windows 8. My current hard drive was out of space,...

      <p class='blog_preview'>If your key is compromised or simply lost, you'll need to revoke it. This relies on generation of a revocation key. Backing Up Your Key and Generating a Revocation Certificate If you are signing your gems and haven't done this yet, please do so: Note that the exported secret key is still encrypted with your passphrase and relatively safe. However, the revocation certificate is not. if someone gains access to your revocation certificate, they can...

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>Verifying gems is all well and good, but what happens if you want to build rubygems-openpgp from the source on github. How can you verify that you have the right source code? Fortunately git allows you to digitally sign tags. All rubygems-openpgp releases are tagged and signed in the git repository. Getting the Source Checking a Release Tag Signature All the standard caveats about authenticating signing keys apply. This step is only useful if you've...

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>Trust is important when it comes to software packages. Unfortunately it's also an overloaded word that has multiple meanings. Lets talk about three different kinds of trust. Trust (a.k.a. Trustworthiness) This one is the most important. Unfortunately it's also the hardest one to verify pragmatically. How do you know that this gem you install won't fry your hard drive? That it won't install a key-logger? You don't. And unfortunately this is very hard to verify...

      </h3>
      <p class='blog_preview'>This is a contentious topic. It's right up there with Emacs vs Vim. Kirk vs Picard. Jesus vs Santa. Etc. Some people have been dismissive of rubygems-openpgp. "Why not use X.509? That has native ruby libraries! You don't need to rely on gpg!" And I'm ashamed to say I've been equally dismissive. "Because X.509 sucks! It's broken! Totally wrong for open source!" And then a third party will chime in, "Why are you arguing about...

After all, this site is dedicated to software verification. Keep your hand up if you've ever downloaded a linux distribution from the web. I imagine a few hands dropped, but we're all software developers here, and most of us have probably played with linux. Now keep your hand up...
