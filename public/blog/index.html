This release corrects a minor issue where a Windows machine couldn't
sign an existing gem built on linux.

Verifying Your Initial Install

Existing users of rubygems-openpgp can verify the install with
rubygems-openpgp itself:



It is recommended that new users fetch the gem and verify it against a
detached signature.  Instructions on how to do so can be found at the
Guide to Verifying Your Initial Install.

      <p class='blog_preview'>I'm currently adding a key continuity feature to rubygems-openpgp. It works similar to the way that ssh stores copies of known host keys, and warns you if the key has changed. This is the first time I'm trying to store any changes locally, and was a bit worried about the directories being created properly on Windows. So I decided to setup a VirtualBox install of Windows 8.

      <p class='blog_preview'>Trust is important when it comes to software packages. Unfortunately it's also an overloaded word that has multiple meanings. Lets talk about three different kinds of trust. Trust (a.k.a. Trustworthiness) This one is the most important. Unfortunately it's also the hardest one to verify pragmatically. How do you know that this gem you install won't fry your hard drive? That it won't install a key-logger? You don't. And unfortunately this is very hard to verify...
