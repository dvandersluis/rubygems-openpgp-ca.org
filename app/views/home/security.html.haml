%h2 Signing Process

%p

  Various safeguards and checks are put into place to secure the
  signing process.

%h3 Master Signing Key authenticates the current Signing Key

%p

  A master signing key authenticates the current active signing key.
  If the signing key is compromised, it will be revoked and a new one
  will take its place.  The master signing key was generated on a
  computer that has never been and will never be on a network.  To
  compromise the master key an attacker would need to access this
  computer physically at its current undisclosed location.

  User key authentication requires control of user's private key and
  email address

%p

  When you register a private key, an encrypted email is sent with an
  authentication link.  To be able to activate the key, someone must:

%ul

  %li Have control of your email address.

  %li Be able to use your private key.

%p

  With reasonable security precautions it is difficult for an attacker
  to gain access to both of these.

%h3 Signing occurs over an 'air gap'

%p

  Signatures are not issued via the web server where you registered
  your key.  After you have authenticated your key with the web
  server, the information is transferred to a signing computer via an
  'air gap'.  It is placed on a USB drive and migrated to the signing
  computer.

%p

  If the web server is compromised, an attacker cannot get to the
  signing computer.

%h3 Signing computer is physically located on-site

%p

  It is not in the cloud.  It is physically controlled by us.

%h3 Keys are validated by a human before signing

%p

  A human performs a sanity check on the key before signing it to
  ensure that it is actually tied to the email account that a user
  registered with.

  For example, somone could create a user id of "User X
  (billg@microsoft.com) registered_email@example.org" to trick
  automatic validation of the UID.

%h3 Signing key is on an OpenPGP smart card

%p

  Once we're on the signing computer, the signing key is contained on
  an OpenPGP smart card that is only inserted and activated for the
  duration of signing.

%p

  If the signing computer is compromised remotely, an attacker won't
  be able to physically insert the smart card and activate it.

%p

  If the signing computer is compromised locally, an attacker still
  requires access to the smart card.

%p

  If the smart card lost or stolen, an attacker only has three
  attempts to enter a passphrase before the card lock itself down.
  Attempting to unlock the card unsuccessfully three times will cause
  the card to self destruct.

%p
 
  An attacker can't mount a brute force attack.
