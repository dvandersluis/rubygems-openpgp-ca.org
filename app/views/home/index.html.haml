%h1 Welcome

%p This is the future home of experimental rubygems-openpgp Certificate Authority.

%p.warning

  NOTE: This project is experimental in nature.  Any representations
  regarding authentication or authority should be taken with a grain
  of salt.  This project has no affiliation with either the rubygems
  project or rubygems.org

%p

  The goal of this project is to provide:

  %ul
    %li

      A single entity for gem users to authenticate and trust (or not)
      instead of having to authenticate hundreds of individual gem
      developers.

    %li

      %a{:href => authentication_url} Basic authentication of developers

      and their signing keys to provide some assurances
      that gems are signed by an authorized key.

    %li

      A

      %a{:href => key_security_url} secure signing process

      that prevents a malicious user from
      issuing bogus signatures on our behalf.

%h2 Getting Started...

%h3 For users

%p Download the key:

%pre gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x6094099A

%p Somehow authenticate the key.

%p Mark the key as trusted on their local keyring:

%pre gpg --lsign 0x6094099A

%p Verify the test gem:

%pre gem install openpgp_signed_hola --verify

%p More info here...

%h3 For developers

%p Generate a key

%p Register it with keyservers

%p sign your gem when you build it.

%p Register your key with us.
