%h1 Ruby Gem OpenPGP Cerfificate Authority

%p Future home of experimental OpenPGP Certificate Authority

%p NOTE: This project is experimental in nature.

%p
  NOTE: This project has no affiliation with either the rubygems
  project or rubygems.org

%p

  The goal of this project is to provide a basic certificate authority
  for gems signed via rubygems-openpgp.  It validates that:

  %ul
    %li The key owner has control of the associated email.
    %li The key owner does indeed have control of the private key.

  This allows users to put a limited amount of trust in our key, and
  use that to verify various gems that have:

  %ul
    %li been signed via rubygems-openpgp.
    %li had signing keys registered here.

%h2 For users

%p Download the key:

%pre gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xDEADBEEF

%p Somehow authenticate the key.

%p Mark the key as trusted on thier local keyring:

%pre gpg --lsign 0xDEADBEEF

%h2 For developers

%p Generate a key

%p Register it with keyservers

%p sign your gem when you build it.

%p Register your key with us.
