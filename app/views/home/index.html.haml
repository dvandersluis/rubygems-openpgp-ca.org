%h1 Welcome

%p This is the future home of experimental rubygems-openpgp Certificate Authority.

%p.warning

  NOTE: This project is experimental in nature.  Any representations
  regarding authentication or authority should be taken with a grain
  of salt.  This project has no affiliation with either the rubygems
  project or rubygems.org

%p

  The goal of this project is to provide:

  %ul
    %li

      A single entity for gem users to authenticate and trust (or not)
      instead of having to authenticate hundreds of individual gem
      developers.

    %li

      %a{:href => authentication_url} Basic authentication of developers

      and their signing keys to provide some assurances
      that gems are signed by an authorized key.

    %li

      A

      %a{:href => key_security_url} secure signing process

      that prevents a malicious user from
      issuing bogus signatures on our behalf.

%h2 Getting Started...

%h3 For gem users

%ol

  %li

    Install

    %a{:href => "https://github.com/grant-olson/rubygems-openpgp"} rubygems-openpgp

    %pre

      gem install rubygems-openpgp

  %li

    Attempt to verify the test gem:

    %pre gem install openpgp_signed_hola --verify

    Note that the verify operation will succeed (will it?), but the
    signature will be untrusted:

    %pre
      :preserve
        gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
        gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

  %li

    Download the signing key:

    %pre gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x6094099A

  %li

    Authenticate the key by comparing the fingerprint against a known
    good copy.  (

    %a{:href=>"https://github.com/grant-olson/rubygems-openpgp-ca.org"}Github

    )

    %pre gpg --fingerprint --list-key 0x6094099A

  %li

    Generate your signing key.

    %pre gpg --gen-key

  %li

    Mark the key as trusted on their local keyring:

    %pre gpg --lsign 0x6094099A

  %li

    Verify the test gem:

    %pre gem install openpgp_signed_hola --verify

    Note that the gem is now trusted.

%h3 For gem developers

%ol

  %li

    Generate a signing key.

    %pre gpg --gen-key

  %li

    Register it with keyservers.  (After creating an offline backup and
    revocation certificate.)

    %pre gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys 0xDEADBEEF

  %li

    Install 

    %a{:href => "http://github.com/grant-olson/rubygems-openpgp"} rubygems-openpgp

    %pre gem install rubygems-openpgp

  %li

    Sign your gem when you build it.

    %pre gem build foo.gemspec --sign

  %li

    Apply to register your key with us.

  %li 
    
    If you didn't do so, create an offline backup and revocation
    certificate of your signing key.

  %li 
    
    If you still didn't do so, create an offline backup and revocation
    certificate of your signing key.

    %pre

      :preserve
        cd /media/usb_stick
        gpg --export-secret-key 0xDEADBEEF > key_backup.gpg
        gpg --gen-revoke 0xDEADBEEF > key_revoke.gpg
