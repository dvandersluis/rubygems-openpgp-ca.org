%h1 Welcome

%p.warning

  NOTE: The CA component project has been deprecated due to lack of
  use.  The signing plugin <a href=
  "https://github.com/grant-olson/rubygems-openpgp">rubygems-openpgp</a>
  is still actively maintained and can be used to sign gems with
  OpenPGP if you wish.

%p

  The goal of this project is to provide:

  %ol
    %li

      A mechanism for gem users and developers to sign and verify gems
      that is simple and immediately usable via a

      %a{:href=>"https://github.com/grant-olson/rubygems-openpgp"} rubygems plugin

      \.

    %li

      A single entity for gem users to authenticate and trust (or not)
      instead of having to authenticate hundreds of individual gem
      developers.

    %li

      %a{:href => '/blog/authentication.html'} Basic authentication of developers

      and their signing keys to provide some assurances
      that gems are signed by an authorized key.

    %li

      A

      %a{:href => '/blog/signing-key-security.html'} secure signing process

      that prevents a malicious user from
      issuing bogus signatures on our behalf.

%p.warning 

  Step one is the most important part.  If we can get developers and
  users to sign and verify gems, there are a multitude of
  authentication methods that can be modeled on top of the core.  This
  can be done independently by any third party, and end users can
  decide what authentication systems they do and don't trust.

%h2 Daily Usage

%h3 For gem users

%p 

  After installation and configuration, you simply add the
  %code --trust
  flag when installing your gems.

%pre

  gem install openpgp_signed_hola --trust

%p

  If the gem can be verified, it will be installed.  If not, you will
  get an error message.  Learn more at

  = "."

%h3 For gem developers

%p

  After installation and configuration, you simply 
  %code --sign
  your gems before pushing to rubygems.org.

%pre 

  gem build foo.gemspec --sign
  gem push foo-0.0.0.gem
