Hello <%= @email %>,

To complete the submission of your application you need to decrypt the
following message and follow the included confirmation link:

<%= encrypted_confirmation(@resource, confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token)) %>

After successfully doing so you should expect your application to be
approved or rejected within 72 hours.

You can check your status here:

<%= user_status_url %>

Thanks,
